Then, **create a Python environment**

Conda:

    conda create -n rag-quiz python=3.12

**activate the environment** with

Conda:

    conda activate rag-quiz

NOTE: You can submit multiple files to be stored in the system, and the generate quiz function will randomly select a file from your list to create a question! Files can be uploaded directly from your computer, OR through URL (content is scraped using Selenium).

### Launching a public demo

By default, the app.py script launches a demo running on a local server. If you would like to create a share-able public link, on the last line of app.py add the "share=True" argument to the Gradio demo launch. This will create a link that lasts for 72 hours as long as you leave the script running, and can be shared with others.

    demo.launch(server_name='0.0.0.0', share=True)
